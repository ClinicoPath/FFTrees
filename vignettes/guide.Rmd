## Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTrees)

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6.5, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# Create a fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) predicting heart disease
heart.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                     data = heartdisease)

# Visualize the best training tree
plot(heart.fft,
     main = "Heart Disease",
     decision.labels = c("Absent", "Present"))
```


A fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) is a set of hierarchical rules for making decisions based on very little information (usually 4 or fewer). For example, the tree above uses data from to decide whether a patient has heart disease or not based on up to 3 pieces of information.

FFTs are simple, transparent decision strategies that use minimal information to make decisions [see @gigerenzer1999fast;@gigerenzer1999good]. They are frequently preferable to more complex decision strategies (such as Logistic Regression) because they rarely over-fit data [@gigerenzer2009homo] and are easy to interpret and implement in real-world decision tasks [@marewski2012heuristic]. They have been used in real world tasks from detecting depression [@jenny2013simple], to making fast decisions in emergency rooms [@green1997alters].

The purpose of the `FFTrees` package is to produce, compare, and display FFTs. The main function in the package is `FFTrees()` which takes formula `formula` and dataset `data` arguments and returns several FFTs which attempt to classify training cases into criterion classes.
