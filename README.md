# FFTrees
A package to create and visualize fast and frugal decision trees (FFTrees)


### Package updates

1.1.4

- Changed the `fft` label to `FFTrees` throughout the package to avoid confusion with fast fourier transform. Thus, the main tree building function is now `FFTrees()` and the new tree object class is `FFTrees`
- Changed `which.tree` argument in `plot.FFTrees()` to `tree`
