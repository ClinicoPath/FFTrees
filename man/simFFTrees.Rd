\title{Generates and summarises many FFTrees objects from multiple training sets}
\usage{
simFFTrees(formula = NULL, data = NULL, max.levels = 5, sim = 10,
  train.p = 0.5, rank.method = "m", hr.weight = 0.5, verbose = FALSE,
  cpus = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{formula. A formula specifying a binary criterion as a function of multiple variables}

\item{data}{dataframe. A dataframe containing variables in formula}

\item{max.levels}{integer. Maximum number of levels considered for the trees.}

\item{sim}{integer. Number of simulations to perform.}

\item{train.p}{numeric. What percentage of the data to use for training in simulations.}

\item{rank.method}{string. How to rank cues during tree construction. "m" (for marginal) means that cues will only be ranked once with the entire training dataset. "c" (conditional) means that cues will be ranked after each level in the tree with the remaining unclassified training exemplars. This also means that the same cue can be used multiple times in the trees. Note that the "c" method will take (much) longer and may be prone to overfitting.}

\item{hr.weight}{numeric. How much weight to give to maximizing hits versus minimizing false alarms (between 0 and 1)}

\item{verbose}{logical. Should progress reports be printed?}

\item{cpus}{integer. Number of cpus to use (any value larger than 1 will initiate parallel calculations in snowfall)}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing best thresholds and marginal classification statistics for each cue
